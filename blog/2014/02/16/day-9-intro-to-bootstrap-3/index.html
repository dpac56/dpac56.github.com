<div class="entry-content"><p><em>I am always bookmarking interesting tutorials that I would do one fine day. Since that day never comes, I have aimed to do one tutorial each day. The topics would broadly be programming, design, marketing and productivity tips. All credit to the original tutorials &ndash; I am just thinking aloud as I type my notes &amp; views on what I read.</em></p>

<p>Day 9: Code a responsive website with Bootstrap 3 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzCmx24xDS4&amp;list=PLUoqTnNH-2Xz_BUrjcahKWDhPcUj-FTOt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzCmx24xDS4&amp;list=PLUoqTnNH-2Xz_BUrjcahKWDhPcUj-FTOt</a></p>

<p>Twitter Bootstrap has been the favorite for developers to design a website quickly. While it will need susbtantial skills to actually build a super-personalized website from Bootstrap &ndash; there is no denying that for building fast, workable websites Bootstrap is one of the best.</p>

<p>Last year Bootstrap 3 was released that comes with the tagline &ndash; Mobile First. What that means is that while earlier large screens were the default and you had to work to make things workable on smaller screens &ndash; now it is the other way round. This playlist looked like a good way to try out the new features.</p>

<p>Just to recap as to why someone would choose Bootstrap framework rather than building one from scratch:</p>

<p>1) Bootstrap is responsive by default &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to do much to make it work across different devices</p>

<p>2) Bootstrap is tested to work across browsers</p>

<p>3) Once you get the hang of it &ndash; it is incredibly fast to build a website since Bootstrap takes care of all the boilerplate code.</p>

<p>You can download the course files (link in Video 2) for reference.</p>

<h3>Okay so lets start coding..</h3>

<p>We will be working on index.html first that is as always going to be the main sheet.</p>

<p>While there is a layout provided, taking a look at the head section, we have:</p>

<p>viewport meta tag: Viewport is the section of the webpage in view. When we put width = device-width we are telling the browser what is the best way to view the webpage. With device-width set we are allowing for responsive design by filling the page to the device width. To ensure that no zooming will be applied, we put the initial-scale = 1. We take a further step by saying that even if the user wanted, there can be no zooming by putting maximum-scale = 1. While this might seem restrictive, it ensures that webpages act more like native applications.</p>

<p>Apart from that, we just have the normla Bootstrap files + modernizr (takes care of older browsers that do not support modern function)</p>

<p>The main body is wrapped in a container class. This is a very important class that makes the inner content boxed centrally. While the navigation is given class of navbar (tells Bootstrap this is navigation element) &amp; navbar-fixed-top (this is how the navigation remains on top while we scroll down)</p>

<h3>One more thing &ndash; I have a bad habit of not commenting basic stuff &amp; the author&rsquo;s style here shows why it is effective. He ends each div with a comment so that you know what is what!</h3>

<p>Add a carousel element below the navbar &amp; give it the class &ldquo;carousel slide&rdquo;. As implied by the name, makes it a slidable carousel.</p>

<p>Remember, the row element is needed to contain the columns (total 12) &ndash; so we add plenty of row element, obviously depending on how many we need :&ndash;).</p>

<p>Outside the container element, we add a footer.</p>

<h3>Couple of things</h3>

<p>footer is put outside the container class since we do not want it to be boxed centrally &ndash; instead want it to stretch full width.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>navbar is also stretched full width inspite of being in the container class since we have given it the fixed-top class.</p>

<p>However, inside the navbar we will put a div with container class since we do not want the text within the navbar to spread full width.</p>

<p>First thing we will put is a link with the class navbar-brand &ndash; this is meant to be your logo.</p>

<p>Next to this we will start adding the navigation content.</p>
