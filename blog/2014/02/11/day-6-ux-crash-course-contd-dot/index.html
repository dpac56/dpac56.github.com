<div class="entry-content"><p><em>I am always bookmarking interesting tutorials that I would do one fine day. Since that day never comes, I have aimed to do one tutorial each day. The topics would broadly be programming, design, marketing and productivity tips. All credit to the original tutorials &ndash; I am just thinking aloud as I type my notes &amp; views on what I read.</em></p>

<p>Day 6: The UX Crash Course <a href="http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals">http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals</a></p>

<h3>Scanning patterns: Users don&rsquo;t read, they scan</h3>

<p>Readers scan &ndash; they stop at something that catches their eye, or keep moving on.</p>

<p>The F pattern: Normally, the scanning would be expected to happen in a &lsquo;F&rsquo; or &lsquo;E&rsquo; pattern. That is people will start on the top left &ndash; read right. Then restart on left, skip down a bit, read right if something interesting catches eye. Restart on left &amp; keep moving down. What does this mean? This means that a button on top left will have more chance of being seen than on the top right. That people follow patterns &amp; that you need to be aware of them (or test by heat maps).</p>

<h3>Browsing Vs Searching Vs Discovery</h3>

<p>You must find out which of the above define why users come to your site &ndash; for each would require a different design.</p>

<p>Browsing = Just looking around a store. Users might have shopped here before or heard good things from others. Eitherway they are in a quick scanning mode. Don&rsquo;t overcrowd things &ndash; make them quick &amp; visual.</p>

<p>Searching = specfically looking for something. They will want to systematically go through the options. Filters are good. At first glance users should see the critcial info that motivates them to click further. How much of the info is critical will be a careful choice to not make the design cluttered.</p>

<p>Discovery = Find something that you were not really looking for but allied to why you came to the store for. For the designer this is the question of how to lead people to something they don&rsquo;t know about but would find useful (according to you). Banners don&rsquo;t work &ndash; neither do putting more things in the menu. Think more on the lines of &ndash; If you liked this, you might also like this.</p>

<h3>Page Framework</h3>

<p>Footers &amp; navigation needs to be consistent across all pages.</p>

<p>Main menu is probably the most important thing on your site. Arrange the most important items left to right or top to bottom. Huge sub-menus are never a great idea (unless you positively have not other way)</p>

<p>Be consistent across all pages.</p>

<h3>The Fold, Images &amp; Headlines</h3>

<p>The Fold &ndash; part of your design that is visible before the user scrolls</p>

<p>A large % of users might scroll down, but you must make it clear why they should do that.</p>

<p>Images of people = good. The more emotion an image adds, the better.</p>

<p>Understand that not only the Headline itself is important, but it will also attract attentions to the parts around it. So, if the parts around a headline are not important you are only diverting user attention.</p>

<h3>The Axis of Interaction</h3>

<p>The users will focus attention on edges of alignment you have created. So if you want something to be clicked place it along those edges.</p>

<h3>Forms</h3>

<p>Keep them simple &amp; short.</p>

<p>The information you need will define the questions. The questions will define the input type you use.</p>

<p>Instructions &amp; labels: Don&rsquo;t assume things. Make it clear what you want.</p>

<p>Avoid mistakes in form filling by a) Giving an example answer/format and b) Allowing for common format variations. If there are mistakes make sure the user is guided to the exact field that needs to be corrected.</p>

<h3>Calls to action, Instructions and Labels</h3>

<p>Calls to action: Verb + Benefit + Urgency</p>

<p>Instructions &amp; labels: No lingo. No industry terms. Simple &amp; Clear</p>

<p>Button Labels: Don&rsquo;t give confusing labels like Ok or Yes. Give direct words: Save / Delete etc</p>

<h3>Primary &amp; Secondary Buttons</h3>

<p>Primary Buttons: Lead to actions that are productive for your business like buying, registering etc. These need to be with higher contrast and on the axis.</p>

<p>Secondary Buttons: Lead to actions that you need to provide but don&rsquo;t want used much like cancelling/deleting profile etc. Lighter contrast &amp; Off Axis.</p>

<p>Special Buttons: Unique (&amp; likely the most important) for your app. Give them a special (pattern breaking) treatment.</p>

<h3>User Psychology &ndash; Conditioning</h3>

<p>People do things where they are rewarded and shy away from punishements. These are not actual tangibles but perceptions. Can you create a loop where people are motivated to do some action and the feedback on that action created motivation for next action?</p>

<p>Conditioning comes into play when since people received a positive feeling 9 out of 10 times, they will come again to do the same.</p>

<h3>User Psychology &ndash; Persuasion</h3>

<p>This was a great topic &amp; if you are into core UX design I have a feeling that the author&rsquo;s book would be a great resources.</p>

<p>These are the 8 attributes of persuasion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Credibility: Have you shown why they should trust you</li>
<li>Know your audience: If you don&rsquo;t know your audience, how will you know what they look for?</li>
<li>Open &amp; Disarm: Open with the user&rsquo;s interest immediately. You need to get them engaged with a headline or a great photo</li>
<li>Create Rapport: Make them feel a part of the group by using words they understand</li>
<li>Isolate: When you have sufficiently advanced them on a path, focus on one thing</li>
<li>Convince: You might need another wave of info to convince them</li>
<li>Close the deal: A simple click to finish the transaction</li>
<li>Continue: Follow up even after the deal</li>
</ol>
